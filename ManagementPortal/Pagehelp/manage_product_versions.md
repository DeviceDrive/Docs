Product versions identify which CLIENT firmware versions (your firmware files) and WRF01 firmware versions belongs together. Here you can upload your firmware files and define product versions for each of your products.
Use the OTA feature (different tab) to manage devices to be upgraded to specific product versions.

# Get started
1. See the video
2. Build the firmware files from your source code
3. Define a new CLIENT version
4. Upload your firmware
5. Define the WRF01 firmware version to be used with your firmware 

When the product version is saved, it can be used in an OTA upgrade group.
